The Conservative Python 3 Porting Guide
=======================================

A guide for people for whom Python 3 is a necessary nuisance, written for
large, conservative codebases that need to start supporting Python 3.


Building
--------

To build the documentation locally, use a Python 3 virtualenv,
install sphinx:

    $ python -m pip install sphinx

... and run it:

    $ make html


Testing
-------

We have a few automatic tests. To run them, install dependencies:

    $ python -m pip install -r test-requirements.txt

... and run:

    $ python -m pytest -v
